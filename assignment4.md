**Caty Buchaniec**

## Question 1: A link to the dataset, your questions, as well as the answers to those questions.

Link: 

* Which country completed the most activities done by an astronaut or cosmonaut outside a spacecraft beyond the Earth's appreciable atmosphere?
Answer: 

* What was the longest duration of an EVA activity? 
Answer: 

* Which crew member completed the most EVA activities? 
Answer:

## Question 2: Write down all steps used to clean and analyze the data, including any Excel formulas.

1. I first downloaded the data as a .csv file from the NASA website. 
2. After opening the file in excel, I copied the data onto another sheet
3. I added five columns to the right over the "Crew" category. I then used the text to column feature by going to Data -> Text to Columns -> selected "delimited" and then hit next -> I then unclicked "tab" and clicked "space" -> I then entered the new five columns as the destination -> then I hit "finish"
4. Now that each first name and last name was separated, I wanted to join each first and last name pair. I did so by using the CONCAT function for each pair. I then copied and pasted the values into the next sheet. I added the labels "Crew 2" and "Crew 3" to the second and third pair name columns, respectively. I also deleted the purpose column. 

## Question 3: Write a sample headline and nut graf based on the most interesting of the three questions.
