# **Pitch Idea**

### *What impact have drone strikes had on terrorist activity immediately following a strike?*

* Data Available
  * The New America Foundation tracks information on U.S. drone strikes abroad, detailing the number of casualties, total strikes, total deaths, total civilian deaths, and total militant deaths. Furthermore, the Global Terrorism Database keeps track of terrorist activities taken by militant groups. 
  * I think it would be interesting to contrast the number of drone strikes taken in certain countries and compare it with the amount of terrorist activity in the weeks/months after each strike to see if there was any measurable difference in terms of terrorist activity levels.   
* With the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, there is increased attention on the ramifications and impact of the War on Terror. Drone strikes and civilian deaths have especially garnered public attention after the U.S. drone strike back in August that left several children dead. Although there are a lot of theoretical arguments explaining the merits and disadvantages of drone strikes, I think looking at the actual numbers could be an interesting take. 
* In terms of sources, I think I would mainly use previous congressional testimony, academic sources working on drone-related issues, and national security activist groups -- all of which are heavily present in DC
