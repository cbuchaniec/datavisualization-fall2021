# **Pitch Idea**

### *What impact have drone strikes had on terrorist activity?*
* Data Available
  * The New America Foundation tracks information on U.S. drone strikes abroad, detailing the number of casualties, total strikes, total deaths, total civilian deaths, and total militant deaths. Furthermore, the Global Terrorism Database keeps track of terrorist activities taken by militant groups. 
  * I think it would be interesting to contrast the number of drone strikes taken in certain countries and compare it with the amount of terrorist activity in the weeks/months after each strike to see if there was any measurable difference in terms of terrorist activity levels.   
* With the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Afghanistan, there is increased attention on the ramifications and impact of the War on Terror. Drone strikes and civilian deaths have especially garnered public attention after the U.S. drone strike back in August that left several children dead. Although there are a lot of theoretical arguments explaining the merits and disadvantages of drone strikes, I think looking at the actual numbers could be an interesting take. 
* In terms of sources, I think I would mainly use previous congressional testimony, academic sources working on drone-related issues, and national security activist groups -- all of which are heavily present in DC. 

# **Critique**

### Clarity and accuracy
* I was able to identify the central insight the reporter was trying to communicate right away, which was that non-urban Alaska communities face significant gaps in law enforcement personnel, funding, and resources. I would rate it a 5/5 for clarity since the main statistic is featured in the hammer and the headline, which was "Lawless: One in three Alaska villages have no local police" and "Special report: A first-of-its-kind investigation by the Anchorage Daily News and ProPublica found more than 70 Alaska communities — places with some of the highest rates of sexual assault in the U.S. — have no local police protection," respectively. 
* The one data graphic featured in the piece was a map of Alaska with red dots signifying the different communities that had no local law enforcement in 2019. It was extremely easy to read; the design was simple and the caption was efficient. I would rate the map a 5/5 in terms of readability. While I do think a map was the most logical way to organize the data, I think that the map could have been improved if the map was made interactive and the reader was able to click on each red dot location to learn more about that specific town. 
* I do think that the data included in the story was accurate since ProPublica and the Anchorage Daily News, and thus I would give them a 4/5 for accuracy. Throughout the article, the reporter cited sources for the numbers included that weren't collected by ProPublica or the Anchorage Daily News, such as data from the University of Alaska Anchorage Justice Center, or linked to the data that the story was referring to. That said, while the article does include a hyperlink to an article explaining the methodology of the data collection practices used by ProPublica and the Anchorage Daily News, I think the article could have benefited from one or two short paragraphs early on in the story explaining how exactly they went about asking the different tribal leaders and local communities about their law enforcement rather than just saying they "asked." Likewise, the article could have included more direct excerpts of the data collected to bolster the summary figures provided. 

### Quality
* As a written piece, I think the quality of the work was good, and I would give it a 3/5 rating. 

### Type and color
* I do not think that this article used type and color to their best purpose, and I would give both categories a 2/5 rating, respectively. Although section headings were bolded and in larger font size than the body font, everything was in the same tone of black -- nothing stood out or caught my attention. The only color featured on the page was in the photographs used throughout the piece, which did draw the eye in with images featuring bright colors starkly contrasting against white-toned backgrounds. As I detail in the next section, I think this piece could have used more data graphics to convey the information featured in the story, which could replace the photographs. Such graphics could create a more cohesive color palette and add in some more color and depth to the overall webpage. That said, although the webpage was a bit bland, all the elements included created a cohesive image -- there were no outlying elements. 

### Creativity 
* In terms of effectiveness, I would rate this story 3/5. While the article did an excellent job of using numbers, I think the manner in which that data was presented could have been improved upon by incorporating more design and graphic elements into the story. Given the story's length, I think adding some charts and graphs to break up the story instead of the photographs used would have been a better and more effective use of space. Furthermore, while the photographs did add a touch of creativity, the piece could've benefited more from data illustrations or numerical graphic components since they would've made the article tighter and drawn the reader more into the data and the numbers of the story.
